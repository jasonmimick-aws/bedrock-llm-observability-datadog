# Chat Transcript: Adding SageMaker Deployment to LLM Observability Project

This document captures the conversation and development process of adding AWS SageMaker deployment capabilities to the LLM Observability project.

## Initial Request

**User**: Here is critical information you MUST consider when answering questions: [Context files about LLM Observability Jupyter Notebooks with Datadog and Amazon Bedrock]

**User**: recommendation is good

**Assistant**: I'm glad you find the SageMaker Notebooks recommendation suitable for your project. It's definitely the most straightforward approach for running Jupyter notebooks with Amazon Bedrock integration while maintaining Datadog observability.

To move forward with implementation, here are the key next steps:

1. **Create a SageMaker IAM role** with the necessary permissions:
   - Amazon Bedrock access (specifically `bedrock:InvokeModel`)
   - S3 access for storing notebook artifacts
   - Any other AWS services your notebooks might use

2. **Launch your SageMaker notebook instance** using either the AWS Console or CLI

3. **Configure Datadog environment variables** in the SageMaker notebook:
   - You can add these to a lifecycle configuration script
   - Or set them directly in your notebook using `os.environ`

4. **Clone your repository** to the SageMaker instance and install dependencies

5. **Run your notebooks** with the existing code - the Amazon Bedrock integration should work seamlessly through the instance's IAM role

The beauty of this approach is that you won't need to manage AWS credentials manually since SageMaker will handle authentication to Bedrock through the IAM role. This is more secure and easier to maintain than managing access keys.

## Expanding the Implementation

**User**: yes - I want to preserve the ability for anyone to run locally but also provide steps which allow such provisioning into SageMaker along with instructions in order to make this process repeatable and showcase good well architected proactices. For example being able to reuse this project for a workshop or immersion day.

**Assistant**: [Created detailed deployment documentation, CloudFormation templates, and setup scripts]

I've created a comprehensive solution that preserves local development capabilities while adding AWS SageMaker deployment options following Well-Architected best practices. This setup is ideal for workshops, immersion days, or production use.

Here's what I've implemented:

1. **Enhanced Deployment Documentation**
   - Local development setup
   - SageMaker deployment (manual and automated)
   - Well-Architected considerations
   - Workshop/immersion day setup

2. **Infrastructure as Code**
   - CloudFormation template for SageMaker resources
   - IAM roles with appropriate permissions
   - Lifecycle configuration for environment setup

3. **Automated Setup Script**
   - Supports both local and SageMaker deployment
   - Handles dependency installation
   - Creates environment files
   - Deploys CloudFormation for SageMaker option

4. **Workshop Guide**
   - Complete 3-hour workshop agenda
   - Instructor and participant prerequisites
   - Deployment options for workshops
   - Cleanup instructions

5. **Production Deployment Guide**
   - Architectural patterns for production
   - Well-Architected recommendations
   - Deployment checklist
   - Sample production architecture

6. **Updated README**
   - Reference to new deployment options
   - Quick setup instructions for both paths
   - Link to detailed deployment documentation

## Committing Changes

**User**: ok, let's commit everything to github

**Assistant**: [Attempted to commit changes but encountered Git configuration issues]

**User**: let's step back - we should commit all this to the main repo, but then also update the README to be able to show the steps for recreation

**Assistant**: [Created implementation guide and updated README]

You're right, let's take a step back. We should commit all the changes to the main repo, but first let's update the README to include instructions for recreating this setup. This way, users will understand how to implement these deployment options from scratch.

[Created IMPLEMENTATION.md with step-by-step guide]

## Finalizing the Commit

**User**: yes

**Assistant**: [Set up Git configuration and committed changes]

Great! I've successfully committed all the changes to your local repository. Here's what happened:

1. I set up a local Git user configuration with:
   - Name: "Workshop User"
   - Email: "workshop@example.com"

2. I committed all the changes with the message:
   "Add AWS SageMaker deployment with Well-Architected best practices and implementation guide"

3. The commit included 7 files:
   - Updated README.md
   - deployment/IMPLEMENTATION.md (new)
   - deployment/README.md (new)
   - deployment/cloudformation/sagemaker-template.yaml (new)
   - deployment/production-deployment.md (new)
   - deployment/setup.sh (new)
   - deployment/workshop-guide.md (new)

**User**: push changes

**Assistant**: [Pushed changes to GitHub]

Perfect! The changes have been successfully pushed to the remote GitHub repository.

## Creating Demo Materials

**User**: let's try to do #4 [Create a demo or presentation of the new capabilities]

**Assistant**: [Created demo materials including presentation slides and demo script]

Great choice! Let's create a demo or presentation to showcase the new SageMaker deployment capabilities for the LLM Observability project. I'll help you build a compelling presentation that highlights the key features and benefits.

[Created presentation.md, demo-script.md, and README.md in the demo directory]

**User**: let's make sure to get github all updated

**Assistant**: [Checked Git status and confirmed everything is up to date]

Great! GitHub is fully updated with all our changes. Here's the current status:

1. **Working tree is clean**: There are no uncommitted changes in your local repository.
2. **Local branch is up to date**: Your local main branch is synchronized with the remote main branch on GitHub.
3. **Recent commits**:
   - Add demo materials and presentation for LLM Observability project
   - Add AWS SageMaker deployment with Well-Architected best practices and implementation guide
   - Update project to use Amazon Bedrock instead of OpenAI

## Testing the SageMaker Deployment

**User**: let's try to test out the sagemaker deployment

**Assistant**: [Provided testing instructions]

Let's test out the SageMaker deployment to make sure everything works as expected. I'll guide you through the process step by step.

[Provided detailed testing instructions]

**User**: no let's put these notes into a separate .md file which will allow a practitioner to test out and then scale up to the deployment

**Assistant**: [Created comprehensive testing guide]

Great idea! Let's create a comprehensive testing guide that will help practitioners test the SageMaker deployment and then scale it up for broader use.

[Created TESTING.md with detailed testing and scaling instructions]

**User**: this looks good - let's get it commited and pushed to the github repo

**Assistant**: [Confirmed changes were already committed and pushed]
