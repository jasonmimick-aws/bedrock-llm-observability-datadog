# Implementation Guide: Adding AWS SageMaker Deployment to an LLM Project

This guide explains how we added AWS SageMaker deployment capabilities to the LLM Observability project while maintaining local development options. Follow these steps to implement similar capabilities in your own projects.

## Step 1: Create the Deployment Directory Structure

```bash
mkdir -p deployment/cloudformation
```

## Step 2: Create Deployment Documentation

Create a comprehensive README in the deployment directory that covers:
- Local development setup
- SageMaker deployment options
- Well-Architected considerations

```bash
# Create the deployment README
touch deployment/README.md
```

## Step 3: Create CloudFormation Template

Develop a CloudFormation template that provisions:
- SageMaker notebook instance
- IAM role with appropriate permissions
- Lifecycle configuration for environment setup

```bash
# Create the CloudFormation template
touch deployment/cloudformation/sagemaker-template.yaml
```

Key components to include:
- SageMaker notebook instance resource
- IAM role with Bedrock and SageMaker permissions
- Lifecycle configuration for environment setup
- Parameters for customization (instance type, Datadog API key)

## Step 4: Create Automated Setup Script

Develop a bash script that supports both local and SageMaker deployment:

```bash
# Create the setup script
touch deployment/setup.sh
chmod +x deployment/setup.sh
```

The script should:
- Accept command-line arguments for deployment type
- Handle local environment setup
- Deploy CloudFormation stack for SageMaker option
- Validate prerequisites and handle errors

## Step 5: Create Workshop Guide

For workshop or immersion day scenarios, create a detailed guide:

```bash
# Create the workshop guide
touch deployment/workshop-guide.md
```

Include:
- Workshop prerequisites
- Setup instructions for instructors and participants
- Workshop agenda and timeline
- Cleanup instructions

## Step 6: Create Production Deployment Guide

For production considerations, create a separate guide:

```bash
# Create the production guide
touch deployment/production-deployment.md
```

Include:
- Architecture patterns for production
- Well-Architected recommendations
- Deployment checklist
- Sample production architecture

## Step 7: Update Main README

Update the main README to reference the new deployment options:

```bash
# Edit the main README
nano README.md
```

Add:
- Reference to deployment options
- Quick setup instructions for both paths
- Link to detailed deployment documentation

## Step 8: Test the Deployment

Test both deployment paths:

```bash
# Test local setup
./deployment/setup.sh --local

# Test SageMaker deployment
./deployment/setup.sh --sagemaker
```

## Step 9: Commit Changes

Commit all changes to the repository:

```bash
git add README.md deployment/
git commit -m "Add AWS SageMaker deployment options with Well-Architected best practices"
git push origin main
```

## Best Practices Applied

This implementation follows AWS Well-Architected best practices:

1. **Security**:
   - IAM roles with least privilege
   - Secure handling of API keys
   - Isolation of resources

2. **Reliability**:
   - Automated deployment reduces human error
   - Consistent environment setup
   - Proper error handling

3. **Performance Efficiency**:
   - Right-sized SageMaker instances
   - Efficient resource utilization
   - Optimized deployment process

4. **Cost Optimization**:
   - Auto-shutdown of notebook instances when idle
   - Right-sized resources
   - Cost-effective deployment options

5. **Operational Excellence**:
   - Infrastructure as Code
   - Automated setup
   - Comprehensive documentation
